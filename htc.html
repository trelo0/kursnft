            <h1>Once again: so what is NFT?</h1>
            <p>The term "interchangeable" is used to refer to something that is not unique. For example, banknotes,
                company shares, sweets in a box of chocolates, and so on are not unique. This means that one such item
                can be replaced with a similar one without any change in value.</p>
            <p>At the same time, there are non-interchangeable things - with them everything is exactly the opposite.
                They are unique or rare and cannot be replaced by another similar item. For example, an old pocket watch
                that your grandfather gave you is unique. This is a completely different story, because here we are
                talking about something irreplaceable or emotions that cannot be recreated with the help of something
                else. All of the above are non-interchangeable.</p>
            <p>The same goes for Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa or Vincent van Gogh's Starry Night. Of course, these
                works have copies, but the original exists only one. And it cannot be replaced.

                And now we take any of the listed items and represent it on the blockchain using a unique cryptocurrency
                token. This is the non-fungible NFT token. These NFTs are stored on the blockchain and serve as proof of
                ownership of some real or virtual asset. On top of that, being on a blockchain makes NFTs secure and
                immutable, so no one can change the data on them.</p>
            <p>The ability of NFTs to validate the uniqueness of an item in a provable and secure manner can be of great
                benefit in many industries. For example, NFT tokens will be useful in games for representing unique
                in-game items, deals with unique works of art, respecting copyright in music albums, verifying
                ownership, and much more.</p>

                        <p>The world of NFTs is completely different. Here it is you - the creator -
                            who controls everything that happens with your work. There are global NFT trading platforms
                            that will showcase your work to the world. You do not have to sign a contract with a gallery
                            or agency to sell your work. There is no need to share profits with intermediaries either.
                            In general, trading platforms for NFTs will even be able to provide you with a percentage of
                            subsequent sales of your work. Accordingly, with each further transaction, you will receive
                            a certain commission from it. In addition to this, NFT will allow you to confirm the
                            originality of your work at any time - as well as the ownership of its owner.</p>

                        <p>It may come as a surprise, but the creation of NFT tokens requires
                            almost no technical knowledge. There are many NFT trading platforms like OpenSea, Rarible or
                            Mintable. With them, you can turn your work into an NFT in minutes.To create an NFT token,
                            you need to connect your cryptocurrency wallet to an NFT-enabled trading platform that you
                            like. After that, you need to go to the "Create" tab on the trading platform, upload the job
                            and press the correct buttons according to the manual. That's it. Your NFT token will be
                            ready for sale very soon. This will happen faster than the mother will call for dinner, the
                            child will cry, or the second half will miss. That is really soon!</p>

                            to a real object that is sold along with the token.</p>
